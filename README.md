# Chrome Extension to show $TSLA's'(Tesla's) Stock price pre 5-1 split

This is a google chrome extension that adds 'The Pre-Split Price would be: XXXXX' to your Yahoo Finance webpage and shows you in real time, what the price would have been before the stock split. There is a crazy complex algorithm used here(current price * 5);
